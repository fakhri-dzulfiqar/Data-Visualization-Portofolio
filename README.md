# Data-Visualization-Portofolio

This portfolio showcases my work in data analysis using Python, 
focusing on the analysis of cooking oil prices in East Java wholesale markets during 2023. 
The data was sourced from the official website [siskaperbapo.jatimprov.go.id](http://siskaperbapo.jatimprov.go.id/). 
The analysis employs various forecasting methods and evaluates their performance.

## Contents

### 1. Data Visualization and Forecasting
- *Description:* This section presents the visualization of cooking oil price trends using different forecasting methods. The visualizations include:
  - *Simple Moving Average (SMA):* A method to smooth price data and identify trends.
  - *Linear Regression:* A statistical method to model the relationship between price and time.
  - *Support Vector Regression (SVR):* A machine learning model used for regression challenges.
  - *Neural Network:* An advanced model for capturing complex patterns in the data.
  - *Commodity Channel Index (CCI):* An indicator used to identify cyclical trends in commodity prices.

- *Evaluation Metrics:* The performance of each forecasting method is assessed using:
  - *Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):* A measure of the differences between predicted and actual values.
  - *Squared Correlation (R²):* A statistic that explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variable.

- *Tools:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights
- *Trend Analysis:* Visualization of cooking oil price trends over 2023, showing peaks and troughs.
- *Forecasting Comparison:* Comparative analysis of different forecasting methods, highlighting the most accurate model based on RMSE and R² metrics.
- *Price Indicators:* Identification of potential market signals using the Commodity Channel Index (CCI).
